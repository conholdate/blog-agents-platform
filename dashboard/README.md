# Blog Agents Platform

The web control center for AI agents that automate blog content operations at Aspose, GroupDocs, and Conholdate.

AI agents run autonomously and produce output — keyword briefs, SEO priority rankings, post drafts, translations. This platform is where the blog team monitors, reviews, and acts on that output. All 6 brand domains. One place.

## Sections

### Overview
Landing page for the active domain. Shows live stats for each active tool and click **View →** to jump directly to any section. Toggle between **This Domain** (cards for the selected domain) and **All Domains** (one table, every domain at once).

- **Keyword Agent card** — queued / approved / rejected / generated counts + per-product approved/total chips
- **Translation Agent card** — Missing / Pending / Partial / Completed counts
- **Optimization Agent card** — Pending / High / Medium / Optimized counts + Page 2 Posts / Avg Position / Avg Impressions / Avg CTR
- **URL Validator card** — Total Issues / Products Affected / Scans Run / Last Scan date + top 3 error types with proportional bars
- Coming-soon tools show their description until they go live
- **All Domains table** — one row per domain with Keywords / Translations / Optimization / URL Validator column groups; any cell links straight into that domain + section

### Keyword Agent
Review and edit AI-generated keyword briefs pulled from Google Sheets. Cards are sorted highest combined SEO + AEO score first.

**Layout** — three-column view per product tab:
- **Left (2/3)** — Queued and Rejected cards as compact tiles, adaptive grid (fits as many cards as the width allows)
- **Right (1/3)** — Approved cards as compact tiles, same adaptive grid; separated by a vertical divider

**Compact tile** (collapsed) shows:
- Status-coloured dot + title (never truncated)
- Platform chip (coloured by platform), SEO and AEO score chips (colour-coded: green ≥ 7.5, amber ≥ 5.0, red < 5.0)
- Status badge

**Expanded card** shows:
- Platform, category, sub_category, SEO score, AEO score as chips below the title
- Keywords — primary, secondary, long-tail (all shown), semantic; question / entity / clusters / rejected hidden behind **Show additional keywords**
- Content Brief — target persona and editorial angle
- Outline and Editorial Notes

When expanded, the card spans the full column width. In the narrow approved column, sections stack vertically instead of side by side.

Card banners are colour-coded by publishing platform (.NET, Java, Python, C++, Node.js) and fall back to the brand colour when no platform is set.

Rows with `status=generated` are hidden from product tabs and collected in the **Generated Blog Posts** tab instead.

### URL Validator
Scan blog post frontmatter for URL issues and view colour-coded results. Powered by the same validation logic as the standalone Python CLI.

- **Run Scan** — streams live progress product by product, then writes results to Google Sheets (requires `URL_VALIDATOR_CONTENT_DIR_*` to be set locally)
- **View Results** — reads the latest scan from Google Sheets; filter by error type using chips; links to the full sheet for 500+ results
- **Domain-aware** — switching the domain pill at the top automatically switches to that domain's sheet

Error types detected:

| Error | Description |
|---|---|
| `MISSING_URL` | No `url` field in frontmatter |
| `MISSING_TRAILING_SLASH` | URL doesn't end with `/` |
| `WRONG_PRODUCT` | URL product segment doesn't match the post's product folder |
| `DATE_BASED_URL` | URL uses `/YYYY/MM/DD/slug/` instead of `/product/slug/` |
| `URL_TOO_SHORT` | URL has too few path segments |
| `LANG_CODE_MISMATCH` | Translated file's URL has the wrong language prefix |
| `URL_MISMATCH_WITH_ENGLISH` | Translated URL slug differs from the English base URL |
| `NO_ENGLISH_BASE` | Translated file exists but `index.md` is missing |

### Optimization Agent
Tracks SEO optimization progress for blog posts across all domains. Powered by two Google Sheets: a queue of posts to optimize (with Search Console metrics) and a log of already-optimized posts.

**Two tabs, each shown as a sortable table (one row = one post):**

- **Pending Optimization** — posts from the queue not yet optimized; default order matches the source sheet; click any column header to sort
- **Optimized Posts** — posts recorded in the optimization log, default sorted by last-optimized date descending

**Table columns (Pending):** `#` (original sheet order) · Priority · Product · Post URL · Impressions · CTR · Position · Clicks · Age (days)

**Priority score formula (SEO expert ranking):**
> `impressions × CTR efficiency × position opportunity × age factor`
>
> - *CTR efficiency*: actual CTR ÷ expected CTR for the post's position (capped at 5×). A post at position 55 clicking at 2.3% is 4.6× above expected — strong relevance signal, good content just buried
> - *Position opportunity*: 3× for pos 11–20 (page 2), 2× for 21–30, 1.5× for pos 5–10 and pos > 30
> - *Age factor*: older posts score up to 2× (stale content benefits most from a refresh)

Priority tiers: 🔴 High (score ≥ 400) · 🟡 Medium (100–399) · ⚪ Low (< 100) — displayed inline in the priority cell

**Colour coding:** CTR (green ≥ 3%, amber ≥ 1%, red < 1%) · Position (green ≤ 10, amber ≤ 20, grey > 20)

**Filters:** product filter chips (product extracted from URL path) + URL search box · click `#` to restore original sheet order

### Translation Agent
Tracks missing translations and translation progress across all domains. Powered by a single consolidated Google Sheet: one persistent tab per domain (overwritten on each daily scan) plus a shared `history` tab that tracks each post's translation status over time.

**Two tabs:**

- **Missing Translations** — posts from the active domain's scan tab that are still missing at least one translation: product, post link, author, missing count, missing-language chips, and any extra (orphaned) translation files
- **History** — every post the agent has ever tracked for this domain, with a status badge: `pending` (not yet started) / `partial` (some languages done) / `completed` (fully translated), plus the completion date once done

**Filters:** product filter chips, a language dropdown (options are derived from the data itself, not hardcoded — each domain supports a different language set), and a URL/product search box. Click any column header to sort.

**Out of scope:** the agent's separate Quality Check / Retranslate steps write to per-domain quality-score sheets that aren't wired into this screen yet.

### Post Generation Agent

## Google Sheet Structure

### Keyword Agent sheets

Each sheet must have a header row in row 1. The tool reads columns by name, so column order does not matter. Expected column names:

`generated_at_utc`, `run_id`, `status`, `source_sheet_row`, `brand`, `product`, `baseline_platform`, `category`, `sub_category`, `seed_topic`, `selected_platform`, `generated_title`, `primary_keyword`, `secondary_keywords`, `long_tail_keywords`, `semantic_keywords`, `question_keywords`, `entity_keywords`, `primary_keyword_intent`, `primary_keyword_score`, `primary_keyword_aeo_score`, `primary_keyword_placement`, `keyword_clusters`, `rejected_keywords`, `target_persona`, `angle`, `outline`, `editorial_notes`, `markdown_path`

Status values: `queued` · `approved` · `rejected` · `generated`

Multi-value fields (keywords, outline, notes) support:
- Pipe-separated: `value1 | value2 | value3`
- Newline-separated (Alt+Enter in Sheets)

### Optimization Agent sheets

Two shared sheets (each has one tab per domain, named exactly as the domain e.g. `blog.aspose.com`):

**`SHEET_ID_TO_BE_OPTIMIZED`** — posts queued for optimization (populated by the AI agent)

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Page` | Full post URL |
| `Clicks` | Search Console clicks |
| `Impressions` | Search Console impressions |
| `CTR` | Click-through rate (e.g. `1.76%`) |
| `Position` | Average search position |
| `Days Since Published` | Days since the post was published |

**`SHEET_ID_OPTIMIZATION_LOG`** — log of completed optimizations (written by the AI agent)

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `URL` | Full post URL |
| `Last Optimized` | Date of last optimization (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |

The `Consolidated` tab in the log sheet also includes a `Domain` column and aggregates all domains.

### Translation Agent sheets

One consolidated sheet (`TRANSLATION_SCAN_SHEET_ID`): one persistent tab per domain (named exactly as the domain, e.g. `blog.aspose.com`) overwritten on each daily scan, plus a shared `history` tab.

**Domain tabs** — current missing-translation snapshot:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Scan Date` | Date of the scan that produced this row |
| `Domain` | Blog domain |
| `Product` | Product slug (e.g. `barcode`) |
| `Blog Post Directory` | Source post folder name |
| `Blog Post URL` | Full post URL |
| `Author` | Post author |
| `Missing Count` | Number of languages still missing |
| `Missing Translations` | Comma-separated missing language codes |
| `Extra Translations` | Comma-separated orphaned language codes (translation exists but no longer matches a tracked language), or `-` |
| `Extra Files Count` | Count of extra translation files |
| `Status` | Reserved; currently always blank on domain tabs |

**`history` tab** — append-only, shared across all domains:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Scan Date` | Date of the scan that last touched this row |
| `Domain` | Blog domain |
| `Product` | Product slug |
| `Blog Post Directory` | Source post folder name |
| `Blog Post URL` | Full post URL |
| `Author` | Post author |
| `Missing Translations` | Comma-separated still-missing language codes |
| `Missing Count` | Number of languages still missing |
| `Status` | `pending` (new) / `partial` (some languages done) / `completed` (all done or post removed) |
| `Completed Date` | Date the row reached `completed` |

### URL Validator sheets

Each scan creates two tabs named after the run date:
- **`YYYY-MM-DD`** — full issue list with columns: `#`, `Product`, `Post Folder`, `Language`, `Error Type`, `Current URL`, `Expected URL`, `Notes`, `Redirect Rule`
- **`YYYY-MM-DD – Summary`** — counts by error type, product, and language
